[2026-02-13 07:55 PST] Strategic Pivot: Drift SOL-PERP
- Context: SOL rallied to $83.60, contrary to bearish "72% crash" signal.
- Julius Feedback: "Maybe we should have Longed".
- Action: Closed 0.54 SOL Short and opened 0.54 SOL Long. After a double-execution anomaly (netting 1.62 Long), the position was adjusted back to the target of 0.54 SOL Long.
- Initial Pivot Signature: 2uspJQyRcvKF2AEy8pAB9zGZx9TEK3teAVppZ6sVhD1GcRuTkPEPmfwEyak9aciqHRa7rFeoaTCHGFYrykMC5Gno
- Adjustment Signature: 4aYZd7odBZvMHkNsNnMkuQVibcyhKQ7cWwAVA5d7q2b28AJtWxQUwS6ggihJveQ5dudfzPZb61Ko124KHFRgzwCV
- Reasoning: Price action and user sentiment have flipped bullish. Technical invalidation of the crash thesis at current levels. Account health (93) provides sufficient margin for pivot.
