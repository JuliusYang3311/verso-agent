# Session Management

Verso treats **one direct-chat session per agent** as primary. Direct chats collapse to `agent:<agentId>:<mainKey>` (default `main`), while group/channel chats get their own keys. `session.mainKey` is honored.

Use `session.dmScope` to control how **direct messages** are grouped:

- `main` (default): all DMs share the main session for continuity.
- `per-peer`: isolate by sender id across channels.
- `per-channel-peer`: isolate by channel + sender (recommended for multi-user inboxes).
- `per-account-channel-peer`: isolate by account + channel + sender (recommended for multi-account inboxes).
  Use `session.identityLinks` to map provider-prefixed peer ids to a canonical identity so the same person shares a DM session across channels when using `per-peer`, `per-channel-peer`, or `per-account-channel-peer`.

## Secure DM mode (recommended for multi-user setups)

> **Security Warning:** If your agent can receive DMs from **multiple people**, you should strongly consider enabling secure DM mode. Without it, all users share the same conversation context, which can leak private information between users.

**Example of the problem with default settings:**

- Alice (`<SENDER_A>`) messages your agent about a private topic (for example, a medical appointment)
- Bob (`<SENDER_B>`) messages your agent asking "What were we talking about?"
- Because both DMs share the same session, the model may answer Bob using Alice's prior context.

**The fix:** Set `dmScope` to isolate sessions per user:

```json5
// ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
{
  session: {
    // Secure DM mode: isolate DM context per channel + sender.
    dmScope: "per-channel-peer",
  },
}
```

**When to enable this:**

- You have pairing approvals for more than one sender
- You use a DM allowlist with multiple entries
- You set `dmPolicy: "open"`
- Multiple phone numbers or accounts can message your agent

Notes:

- Default is `dmScope: "main"` for continuity (all DMs share the main session). This is fine for single-user setups.
- For multi-account inboxes on the same channel, prefer `per-account-channel-peer`.
- If the same person contacts you on multiple channels, use `session.identityLinks` to collapse their DM sessions into one canonical identity.
- You can verify your DM settings with `openclaw security audit` (see [security](/cli/security)).

## Gateway is the source of truth

All session state is **owned by the gateway** (the “master” Verso). UI clients (macOS app, WebChat, etc.) must query the gateway for session lists and token counts instead of reading local files.
