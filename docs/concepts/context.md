# Context

“Context” is **everything Verso sends to the model for a run**. It is bounded by the model’s **context window** (token limit).

Beginner mental model:

- **System prompt** (Verso-built): rules, tools, skills list, time/runtime, and injected workspace files.
- **Conversation history**: your messages + the assistant's messages for this session.
- **Tool calls/results + attachments**: command output, file reads, images/audio, etc.

Context is _not the same thing_ as “memory”: memory can be stored on disk and reloaded later; context is what’s inside the model’s current window.

## Quick start (inspect context)

- `/status` → quick “how full is my window?” view + session settings.
- `/context list` → what’s injected + rough sizes (per file + totals).
- `/context detail` → deeper breakdown: per-file, per-tool schema sizes, per-skill entry sizes, and system prompt size.
- `/usage tokens` → append per-reply usage footer to normal replies.
- `/compact` → summarize older history into a compact entry to free window space.

## Example output

Values vary by model, provider, tool policy, and what’s in your workspace.

### `/context list`

```
🧠 Context breakdown
Workspace: <workspaceDir>
Bootstrap max/file: 20,000 chars
Sandbox: mode=non-main sandboxed=false
System prompt (run): 38,412 chars (~9,603 tok) (Project Context 23,901 chars (~5,976 tok))

Injected workspace files:
- AGENTS.md: OK | raw 1,742 chars (~436 tok) | injected 1,742 chars (~436 tok)
- SOUL.md: OK | raw 912 chars (~228 tok) | injected 912 chars (~228 tok)
- TOOLS.md: TRUNCATED | raw 54,210 chars (~13,553 tok) | injected 20,962 chars (~5,241 tok)
- IDENTITY.md: OK | raw 211 chars (~53 tok) | injected 211 chars (~53 tok)
- USER.md: OK | raw 388 chars (~97 tok) | injected 388 chars (~97 tok)
- HEARTBEAT.md: MISSING | raw 0 | injected 0
- BOOTSTRAP.md: OK | raw 0 chars (~0 tok) | injected 0 chars (~0 tok)

Skills list (system prompt text): 2,184 chars (~546 tok) (12 skills)
Tools: read, edit, write, exec, process, browser, message, sessions_send, …
Tool list (system prompt text): 1,032 chars (~258 tok)
Tool schemas (JSON): 31,988 chars (~7,997 tok) (counts toward context; not shown as text)
Tools: (same as above)

Session tokens (cached): 14,250 total / ctx=32,000
```

### `/context detail`

```
🧠 Context breakdown (detailed)
…
Top skills (prompt entry size):
- frontend-design: 412 chars (~103 tok)
- oracle: 401 chars (~101 tok)
… (+10 more skills)

Top tools (schema size):
- browser: 9,812 chars (~2,453 tok)
- exec: 6,240 chars (~1,560 tok)
… (+N more tools)
```

## What counts toward the context window

Everything the model receives counts, including:

- System prompt (all sections).
- Conversation history.
- Tool calls + tool results.
- Attachments/transcripts (images/audio/files).
- Compaction summaries and pruning artifacts.
- Provider “wrappers” or hidden headers (not visible, still counted).

## How Verso builds the system prompt

## How Verso builds the system prompt

The system prompt is **Verso-owned** and rebuilt each run. It includes:

- Tool list + short descriptions.
- Skills list (metadata only; see below).
- Workspace location.
- Time (UTC + converted user time if configured).
- Runtime metadata (host/OS/model/thinking).
- Injected workspace bootstrap files under **Project Context**.

Full breakdown: [System Prompt](/concepts/system-prompt).

## Injected workspace files (Project Context)

By default, Verso injects a fixed set of workspace files (if present):
