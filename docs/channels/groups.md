# Groups

Verso treats group chats consistently across surfaces: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams.

## Beginner intro (2 minutes)

Verso “lives” on your own messaging accounts. There is no separate WhatsApp bot user.
If **you** are in a group, Verso can see that group and respond there.
