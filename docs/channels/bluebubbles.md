# BlueBubbles (macOS REST)

Status: bundled plugin that talks to the BlueBubbles macOS server over HTTP. **Recommended for iMessage integration** due to its richer API and easier setup compared to the legacy imsg channel.

## Overview

- Runs on macOS via the BlueBubbles helper app ([bluebubbles.app](https://bluebubbles.app)).
- Recommended/tested: macOS Sequoia (15). macOS Tahoe (26) works; edit is currently broken on Tahoe, and group icon updates may report success but not sync.
- Verso talks to it through its REST API (`GET /api/v1/ping`, `POST /message/text`, `POST /chat/:id/*`).
- Incoming messages arrive via webhooks; outgoing replies, typing indicators, read receipts, and tapbacks are REST calls.
- Attachments and stickers are ingested as inbound media (and surfaced to the agent when possible).
- Pairing/allowlist works the same way as other channels (`/channels/pairing` etc) with `channels.bluebubbles.allowFrom` + pairing codes.
- Reactions are surfaced as system events just like Slack/Telegram so agents can "mention" them before replying.
- Advanced features: edit, unsend, reply threading, message effects, group management.

## Quick start

1. Install the BlueBubbles server on your Mac (follow the instructions at [bluebubbles.app/install](https://bluebubbles.app/install)).
2. In the BlueBubbles config, enable the web API and set a password.
3. # Run `verso onboard` and select BlueBubbles, or configure manually:
4. Run `openclaw onboard` and select BlueBubbles, or configure manually:

> > > > > > > upstream/main

```json5
{
  channels: {
    bluebubbles: {
      enabled: true,
      serverUrl: "http://192.168.1.100:1234",
      password: "example-password",
      webhookPath: "/bluebubbles-webhook",
    },
  },
}
```

4. Point BlueBubbles webhooks to your gateway (example: `https://your-gateway-host:3000/bluebubbles-webhook?password=<password>`).
5. Start the gateway; it will register the webhook handler and start pairing.

## Keeping Messages.app alive (VM / headless setups)

Some macOS VM / always-on setups can end up with Messages.app going “idle” (incoming events stop until the app is opened/foregrounded). A simple workaround is to **poke Messages every 5 minutes** using an AppleScript + LaunchAgent.

### 1) Save the AppleScript

Save this as:

- `~/Scripts/poke-messages.scpt`

Example script (non-interactive; does not steal focus):

```applescript
try
  tell application "Messages"
    if not running then
      launch
    end if

    -- Touch the scripting interface to keep the process responsive.
    set _chatCount to (count of chats)
  end tell
on error
  -- Ignore transient failures (first-run prompts, locked session, etc).
end try
```

verso onboard

```

The wizard prompts for:

- **Server URL** (required): BlueBubbles server address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:1234`)
- **Password** (required): API password from BlueBubbles Server settings
- **Webhook path** (optional): Defaults to `/bluebubbles-webhook`
- **DM policy**: pairing, allowlist, open, or disabled
- **Allow list**: Phone numbers, emails, or chat targets

You can also add BlueBubbles via CLI:

```

verso channels add bluebubbles --http-url http://192.168.1.100:1234 --password <password>

````

## Access control (DMs + groups)

DMs:

- Default: `channels.bluebubbles.dmPolicy = "pairing"`.
- Unknown senders receive a pairing code; messages are ignored until approved (codes expire after 1 hour).
- Approve via:
  - `verso pairing list bluebubbles`
  - `verso pairing approve bluebubbles <CODE>`
- Pairing is the default token exchange. Details: [Pairing](/start/pairing)

Groups:

- `channels.bluebubbles.groupPolicy = open | allowlist | disabled` (default: `allowlist`).
- `channels.bluebubbles.groupAllowFrom` controls who can trigger in groups when `allowlist` is set.

### Mention gating (groups)

BlueBubbles supports mention gating for group chats, matching iMessage/WhatsApp behavior:

- Uses `agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns` (or `messages.groupChat.mentionPatterns`) to detect mentions.
- When `requireMention` is enabled for a group, the agent only responds when mentioned.
- Control commands from authorized senders bypass mention gating.

Per-group configuration:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    bluebubbles: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
      groups: {
        "*": { requireMention: true }, // default for all groups
        "iMessage;-;chat123": { requireMention: false }, // override for specific group
      },
    },
  },
}
````

### Command gating

- Control commands (e.g., `/config`, `/model`) require authorization.
- Uses `allowFrom` and `groupAllowFrom` to determine command authorization.
- Authorized senders can run control commands even without mentioning in groups.

## Typing + read receipts

- **Typing indicators**: Sent automatically before and during response generation.
- **Read receipts**: Controlled by `channels.bluebubbles.sendReadReceipts` (default: `true`).
- **Typing indicators**: Verso sends typing start events; BlueBubbles clears typing automatically on send or timeout (manual stop via DELETE is unreliable).

```json5
{
  channels: {
    bluebubbles: {
      sendReadReceipts: false, // disable read receipts
    },
  },
}
```

## Advanced actions

BlueBubbles supports advanced message actions when enabled in config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    bluebubbles: {
      actions: {
        reactions: true, // tapbacks (default: true)
        edit: true, // edit sent messages (macOS 13+, broken on macOS 26 Tahoe)
        unsend: true, // unsend messages (macOS 13+)
        reply: true, // reply threading by message GUID
        sendWithEffect: true, // message effects (slam, loud, etc.)
        renameGroup: true, // rename group chats
        setGroupIcon: true, // set group chat icon/photo (flaky on macOS 26 Tahoe)
        addParticipant: true, // add participants to groups
        removeParticipant: true, // remove participants from groups
        leaveGroup: true, // leave group chats
        sendAttachment: true, // send attachments/media
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Available actions:

- **react**: Add/remove tapback reactions (`messageId`, `emoji`, `remove`)
- **edit**: Edit a sent message (`messageId`, `text`)
- **unsend**: Unsend a message (`messageId`)
- **reply**: Reply to a specific message (`messageId`, `text`, `to`)
- **sendWithEffect**: Send with iMessage effect (`text`, `to`, `effectId`)
- **renameGroup**: Rename a group chat (`chatGuid`, `displayName`)
- **setGroupIcon**: Set a group chat's icon/photo (`chatGuid`, `media`) — flaky on macOS 26 Tahoe (API may return success but the icon does not sync).
- **addParticipant**: Add someone to a group (`chatGuid`, `address`)
- **removeParticipant**: Remove someone from a group (`chatGuid`, `address`)
- **leaveGroup**: Leave a group chat (`chatGuid`)
- **sendAttachment**: Send media/files (`to`, `buffer`, `filename`, `asVoice`)
  - Voice memos: set `asVoice: true` with **MP3** or **CAF** audio to send as an iMessage voice message. BlueBubbles converts MP3 → CAF when sending voice memos.

### Message IDs (short vs full)

Verso may surface _short_ message IDs (e.g., `1`, `2`) to save tokens.
