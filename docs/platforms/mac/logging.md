# Logging (macOS)

## Rolling diagnostics file log (Debug pane)

Verso routes macOS app logs through swift-log (unified logging by default) and can write a local, rotating file log to disk when you need a durable capture.

- Verbosity: **Debug pane → Logs → App logging → Verbosity**
- Enable: **Debug pane → Logs → App logging → “Write rolling diagnostics log (JSONL)”**
- # Location: `~/Library/Logs/Verso/diagnostics.jsonl` (rotates automatically; old files are suffixed with `.1`, `.2`, …)

- Clear: **Debug pane → Logs → App logging → “Clear”**

Notes:

- This is **off by default**. Enable only while actively debugging.
- Treat the file as sensitive; don’t share it without review.

## Unified logging private data on macOS

Unified logging redacts most payloads unless a subsystem opts into `privacy -off`. Per Peter's write-up on macOS [logging privacy shenanigans](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/logging-privacy-shenanigans) (2025) this is controlled by a plist in `/Library/Preferences/Logging/Subsystems/` keyed by the subsystem name. Only new log entries pick up the flag, so enable it before reproducing an issue.
