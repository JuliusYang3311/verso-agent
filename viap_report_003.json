  "summary": "Analyst 'Global Intel' reporting. \n\n**Mission Status:** COMPLETED (Manual Fallback). \n**Key Findings:**\n1. **Technological Friction:** A massive leap in quantum computing (Caltech's 6,100 qubits) coincides with a draconian regulatory crackdown on AI (threats of 30-year prison sentences), signaling a 'breakneck vs. brake-check' dynamic.\n2. **Geopolitical Fracture:** The global commons are dissolving. From Arctic resource scrambles to potential withdrawals from UN Climate treaties, nations are prioritizing strategic autonomy over collective governance.\n3. **Economic Asymmetry:** The 'synchronized global recovery' is dead. Central bank policies (Fed vs. BoE) are diverging, creating a fragmented economic landscape of local winners and stagnation zones.\n\n**Distribution:** Tweet draft prepared: 'Global signals intercepted: Quantum leaps meet regulatory cages, and the Arctic heats up. The global consensus is fracturing. Read the full #WorldMonitor analysis. #Geopolitics #AI #Economy'. \n\n**Note:** Due to runtime environment constraints (exec unavailable), the video artifact was realized as a detailed production script/storyboard at the mandated path.",
